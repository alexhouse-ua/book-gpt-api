It’s the question that follows Ariana now that she’s reunited with the boys from the Sound of Us. <br /><br />Haunted by the past and her hopefully soon to be ex-husband, Ari is dragged along as the band continues its world tour. Touring the world together...it’s what they all used to dream about. Sold out stadiums and screaming fans, it’s everything anyone would want. <br /><br />But with broken hearts to mend, groupies to ignore, and someone who clearly wants Ariana to leave for good, is their dream more of a nightmare? Can Ariana discover her own song before it’s too late?",C.R.

It was easy to get wrapped in them, for me to feel like I wasn’t a real person unless I was in their presence, helping them, loving them.<br /><br />Since Gentry’s attack we haven’t been the same, and I’m afraid that the magic we had been working so hard to build may be gone forever. Addiction, jealousy, and fear fill our nights, replacing the spaces that our love used to live.<br /><br />When an opportunity of a lifetime arises for me to chase my dreams, I leap at the chance to do something for myself. But it’s harder than I thought to follow my own path, especially when it begins to divert from theirs.<br /><br />Growing up, I never thought a happy ending was in the cards for me...but a happily ever after with the boys from the Sound of Us has been my dream since I met them.<br /><br />But dreams change, and even though our love story is written across my soul, our path won’t be easy.<br />I know their hearts though, and what’s there is the same as what you can find in mine.<br /><br />My name is Ariana Kent, and losing “us” is not an option.",C.R.

January Andrews writes bestselling romance. When she pens a happily ever after, he kills off his entire cast.<br /><br />They’re polar opposites.<br /><br />In fact, the only thing they have in common is that for the next three months, they're living in neighboring beach houses, broke, and bogged down with writer's block.<br /><br />Until, one hazy evening, one thing leads to another and they strike a deal designed to force them out of their creative ruts: Augustus will spend the summer writing something happy, and January will pen the next Great American Novel. She’ll take him on field trips worthy of any rom-com montage, and he’ll take her to interview surviving members of a backwoods death cult (obviously). Everyone will finish a book and no one will fall in love.

For most of the year they live far apart—she’s in New York City, and he’s in their small hometown—but every summer, for a decade, they have taken one glorious week of vacation together.<br /> <br />Until two years ago, when they ruined everything. They haven’t spoken since.<br /> <br />Poppy has everything she should want, but she’s stuck in a rut. When someone asks when she was last truly happy, she knows, without a doubt, it was on that ill-fated, final trip with Alex. And so, she decides to convince her best friend to take one more vacation together—lay everything on the table, make it all right. Miraculously, he agrees.<br /> <br />Now she has a week to fix everything. If only she can get around the one big truth that has always stood quietly in the middle of their seemingly perfect relationship. What could possibly go wrong?",Emily Henry,,Alex,5,"Thu, 03 Apr 2025 00:00:00","Thu, 02 May 2024 00:00:00","Thu, 02 May 2024 14:14:06 -0700",,,3.85,2021,"<a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55076069-people-we-meet-on-vacation?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss""><img alt=""People We Meet on Vacation"" src=""https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1618913237l/55076069._SY75_.jpg"" /></a><br />

The problem: after being swept into the public eye and battling their addictions, they’re not sure what the worst is anymore. <br /><br />In a sea of many changes—including Ryke &amp; Daisy living with them—Lily realizes that the best part of her fluctuating hormones might just be the worst. <br /><br />Her sex drive is out of control. <br /><br />Loren knows that she’s insatiable, but he’s not giving up on her.

The cause: Daniel Grant, a ridiculously hot carpenter who’s ten years younger than her and as casual as they come—the complete opposite of sophisticated city-girl Alexis. And yet their chemistry is undeniable.<br /><br />While her ultra-wealthy parents want her to carry on the family legacy of world-renowned surgeons, Alexis doesn’t need glory or fame. She’s fine with being a “mere” ER doctor. And every minute she spends with Daniel and the tight-knit town where he lives, she’s discovering just what’s really important. Yet letting their relationship become anything more than a short-term fling would mean turning her back on her family and giving up the opportunity to help thousands of people.<br /><br />Bringing Daniel into her world is impossible, and yet she can’t just give up the joy she’s found with him either.

Two rivals. A plot twist they didn't see coming....</b><br /><br />Nora Stephens’ life is books—she’s read them all—and she is not that type of heroine. Not the plucky one, not the laidback dream girl, and especially not the sweetheart. In fact, the only people Nora is a heroine for are her clients, for whom she lands enormous deals as a cutthroat literary agent, and her beloved little sister Libby.<br /><br />Which is why she agrees to go to Sunshine Falls, North Carolina for the month of August when Libby begs her for a sisters’ trip away—with visions of a small-town transformation for Nora, who she’s convinced needs to become the heroine in her own story. But instead of picnics in meadows, or run-ins with a handsome country doctor or bulging-forearmed bartender, Nora keeps bumping into Charlie Lastra, a bookish brooding editor from back in the city. It would be a meet-cute if not for the fact that they’ve met many times and it’s never been cute.<br /><br />If Nora knows she’s not an ideal heroine, Charlie knows he’s nobody’s hero, but as they are thrown together again and again—in a series of coincidences no editor worth their salt would allow—what they discover might just unravel the carefully crafted stories they’ve written about themselves.",Emily Henry,,Alex,5,"Fri, 11 Apr 2025 00:00:00","Tue, 16 Apr 2024 00:00:00","Tue, 16 Apr 2024 06:07:22 -0700",want-to-read-not-owned,,4.11,2022,"<a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58708383-book-lovers?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss""><img alt=""Book Lovers"" src=""https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1628185821l/58708383._SY75_.jpg"" /></a><br />

Convincing Anh that Olive is dating and well on her way to a happily ever after was always going to take more than hand-wavy Jedi mind tricks: Scientists require proof. So, like any self-respecting biologist, Olive panics and kisses the first man she sees.<br /><br />That man is none other than Adam Carlsen, a young hotshot professor--and well-known ass. Which is why Olive is positively floored when Stanford's reigning lab tyrant agrees to keep her charade a secret and be her fake boyfriend. But when a big science conference goes haywire, putting Olive's career on the Bunsen burner, Adam surprises her again with his unyielding support and even more unyielding...six-pack abs.<br /><br />Suddenly their little experiment feels dangerously close to combustion. And Olive discovers that the only thing more complicated than a hypothesis on love is putting her own heart under the microscope.",Ali Hazelwood,,Alex,5,"Wed, 12 Mar 2025 00:00:00","Wed, 24 Apr 2024 00:00:00","Wed, 24 Apr 2024 10:58:57 -0700",want-to-read-not-owned,,4.11,2021,"<a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59336483-the-love-hypothesis?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss""><img alt=""The Love Hypothesis"" src=""https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1634044730l/59336483._SY75_.jpg"" /></a><br />

If NASA offered her the lead on a neuroengineering project--a literal dream come true after years scraping by on the crumbs of academia--Marie would accept without hesitation. Duh. But the mother of modern physics never had to co-lead with Levi Ward.<br /><br />Sure, Levi is attractive in a tall, dark, and piercing-eyes kind of way. And sure, he caught her in his powerfully corded arms like a romance novel hero when she accidentally damseled in distress on her first day in the lab. But Levi made his feelings toward Bee very clear in grad school--archenemies work best employed in their own galaxies far, far away.<br /><br />Now, her equipment is missing, the staff is ignoring her, and Bee finds her floundering career in somewhat of a pickle. Perhaps it's her occipital cortex playing tricks on her, but Bee could swear she can see Levi softening into an ally, backing her plays, seconding her ideas...devouring her with those eyes. And the possibilities have all her neurons firing.

Sure, she’s got an incredible career as a beloved romance novelist with a slew of bestsellers under her belt, but when she’s asked to give a commencement address, it hits her: she hasn’t been practicing what she’s preached.<br /><br />Fizzy hasn’t ever really been in love. Lust? Definitely. But that swoon-worthy, can’t-stop-thinking-about-him, all-encompassing feeling? Nope. Nothing. What happens when the optimism she’s spent her career encouraging in readers starts to feel like a lie?<br /><br />Connor Prince, documentary filmmaker and single father, loves his work in large part because it allows him to live near his daughter. But when his profit-minded boss orders him to create a reality TV show, putting his job on the line, Connor is out of his element. Desperate to find his romantic lead, a chance run-in with an exasperated Fizzy offers Connor the perfect solution. What if he could show the queen of romance herself falling head-over-heels for all the world to see? Fizzy gives him a hard pass—unless he agrees to her list of demands. When he says yes, and production on <i>The True Love Experiment</i> begins, Connor wonders if that perfect match will ever be in the cue cards for him, too.<br /><br /> <i>The True Love Experiment</i> is the book fans have been waiting for ever since Fizzy’s debut in <i>The Soulmate Equation</i>.

J. Fikry</i> two friends--often in love, but never lovers--come together as creative partners in the world of video game design, where success brings them fame, joy, tragedy, duplicity, and, ultimately, a kind of immortality.</b><br /><br />On a bitter-cold day, in the December of his junior year at Harvard, Sam Masur exits a subway car and sees, amid the hordes of people waiting on the platform, Sadie Green. He calls her name. For a moment, she pretends she hasn't heard him, but then, she turns, and a game begins: a legendary collaboration that will launch them to stardom. These friends, intimates since childhood, borrow money, beg favors, and, before even graduating college, they have created their first blockbuster, <i> Ichigo</i>. Overnight, the world is theirs. Not even twenty-five years old, Sam and Sadie are brilliant, successful, and rich, but these qualities won't protect them from their own creative ambitions or the betrayals of their hearts.<br /><br />Spanning thirty years, from Cambridge, Massachusetts, to Venice Beach, California, and lands in between and far beyond, Gabrielle Zevin's <i>Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow</i> is a dazzling and intricately imagined novel that examines the multifarious nature of identity, disability, failure, the redemptive possibilities in play, and above all, our need to connect: to be loved and to love. Yes, it is a love story, but it is not one you have read before.",Gabrielle Zevin,,Alex,5,"Fri, 13 Jun 2025 00:00:00","Thu, 05 Jun 2025 00:00:00","Thu, 05 Jun 2025 18:13:22 -0700",,,4.13,2022,"<a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/77262337-tomorrow-and-tomorrow-and-tomorrow?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss""><img alt=""Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow"" src=""https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1673647488l/77262337._SY75_.jpg"" /></a><br />

So far, so good, except for two little things. Fine–a little thing and a big, grumpy thing. She needs to improve her game behind the net, and she needs help from Luke Ryder. <br /><br />Ryder is six-foot five, built, opinionated, rude…and sexy as hell. But he's still the enemy. <br /><br />Briar's new hockey co-captain has his reasons, though. The men's team just merged with a rival program, leaving Ryder with an angry roster where everyone hates one another's guts. To make matters worse, the summer coaching spot he's angling for with the legendary Garrett Graham is out of reach after he makes the worst possible first impression on his hero. So, really, this compromise with Gigi is win-win. He helps her make the national team, she puts in a good word with her dad. <br /><br />The only potential snag? This bone-deep, body-numbing, mind-spinning chemistry they're trying to ignore. It's a dangerous game they're playing, but the risks just might be worth it.<br /><br /><b>Et pourtant, il y a un gros hic ! L'alchimie profonde, qui étouffe le corps et fait tourner l'esprit, qu'ils essaient d'ignorer.

No matter how bad he plays, the beautiful, sunny redhead is always on the sidelines. He curses, she cheers. He scowls, she smiles. But when Wells quits in a blaze of glory and his fangirl finally goes home, he knows he made the greatest mistake of his life.<br /><br />Josephine Doyle believed in the gorgeous, grumpy golfer, even when he didn’t believe in himself. Yet after he throws in the towel, she begins to wonder if her faith was misplaced. Then a determined Wells shows up at her door with a wild proposal: be his new caddy, help him turn his game around, and split the prize money. And considering Josephine’s professional and personal life is in shambles, she could really use the cash…<br /><br />As they travel together, spending days on the green and nights in neighboring hotel rooms, sparks fly. Before long, they’re inseparable, Wells starts winning again, and Josephine is surprised to find a sweet, thoughtful guy underneath his gruff, growly exterior. This hot man wants to brush her hair, feed her snacks, and take bubble baths together? Is this real life? But Wells is technically her boss and an athlete falling for his fangirl would be ridiculous… right?",Tessa Bailey,,Alex,5,"Sun, 23 Feb 2025 00:00:00","Thu, 04 Apr 2024 00:00:00","Thu, 04 Apr 2024 10:53:30 -0700","want-to-read-ank-recs, want-to-read-not-owned",,3.81,2024,"<a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/150343880-fangirl-down?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss""><img alt=""Fangirl Down (Big Shots, #1)"" src=""https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1689982215l/150343880._SY75_.jpg"" /></a><br />

After my ex crushed my dreams in the music industry, I’m done with getting my heart broken. Working as an assistant for an NHL player was supposed to be a breeze, but nothing about Jamie Streicher is easy. He’s an intimidatingly hot, grouchy jerk who can't stand me. The guy has a massive ego. Keeping things professional will be no problem, even when he demands I move in with him. Beneath his surliness, though, Jamie’s surprisingly sweet and protective. When Jamie learns how bad my ex was in bed, his competitive nature flares, and he encourages and spoils me in every way. The creative spark I used to feel about songwriting? It’s back, and I’m writing music again. Between wearing his jersey at games, rowdy parties with the team, and being brave on stage again, I’m falling for him. He could break my heart, but it might be worth it. Behind the Net is a grumpy-sunshine pro hockey romance with lots of spice and an HEA.

Notorious serial dater. The NHL’s most eligible bachelor. That’s what the headlines say about me, at least. I wish I could say they’re not accurate, but truthfully? I don’t even know who I am anymore. Between a soul-crushing ex-girlfriend and a never-ending queue of dates gone wrong, one thing has become glaringly I don’t want to be Adam Lockwood.<br /><br />So when my dog decides to play matchmaker, taking down a sweet little thing with rose gold waves, brilliant green eyes, and a smile for days, I can’t believe my luck that she doesn’t have a clue who I am. I know I should tell her, but for once in my life someone sees the man behind the goalie mask. Rosie gives me all of her–her heartache, her laughter, and her son. But me? I’m holding on a little too tightly to the pieces I’m scared to give up, the pieces she might not like. One small lie becomes a secret hanging above my head, but what if there’s another one hiding right around the corner? Suddenly, my deepest desire becomes my biggest fear. I’m terrified she’s going to unravel me.<br /><br />Unravel Me is book #3 in the Playing For Keeps series, a series of interconnected standalone mature hockey romance stories that contain relatable characters, lots of heat, swoon, laughs, and a ride on an emotional rollercoaster!<br /><br />Unravel Me contains emotional references to the past death of parents and its surrounding grief, as well as brief discussions of foster care, depictions of child neglect (not by the main character), and the death of an animal (minimal descriptions and as it pertains to the FMC’s training as a veterinarian student; not main character’s pet).

The slumlord who abandoned this place and let our homes deteriorate has been court ordered to live here while making repairs. Imagine our surprise when the guy who shows up to move in to the dilapidated trailer across the street isn't the sixty year old man we expected, but his son. With a teasing smile and unshakeable positive attitude, Cooper Addington Junior pushes every one of my buttons. It doesn't help that he also looks like he stepped off a fitness magazine cover. The women who live here are all over him, but for some reason he's focused on me. Too bad I see through his good guy act and I'm not falling for some spoiled rich boy. What I am going to do is keep my eye on him and make sure he's doing his job. I'm the one who took his father to court in the first place and he can't put anything over on me. <br /><br />Book Two in the Happy Haven Series of connected standalone novels.

A place where the wealthy rub shoulders and chase hedonistic pleasures. However, behind the mansion’s facade lies a poisonous, hidden underworld.<br /><br />With my father now gone, I am the sole heir to Noire House.

To protect the ones I love, I must allow these men to parade me around and claim me as theirs.<br /><br />Locked away in their remote, forest-bound fortress, I am nothing more than a possession to control. To them, my life–and future–represents payment in kind and vengeance they’ve been denied.<br /><br />In the world of the Anguis, death is the only way out, and these men are handsome grim reapers dressed in fine suits.<br /><br />But as their heated looks and rough, blood-stained hands become more alluring each day, giving in to their games becomes a temptation I can’t avoid. Lines are blurred and longing spills over as I quickly find myself craving their darkness.<br /><br />I can’t succumb to three beautiful monsters… Can I?<br /><br /><b> </b><b>Vengeful Gods</b><b> is a MMFM Why Choose/Reverse Harem Dark Revenge Romance (with MF, MM, and group scenes) 18+ </b><br /><br /><b>Expect a hot, gritty, bisexual, enemies to lovers romance, with ruthless, morally gray, poly love interests.

Relationships, unfortunately, missed the list. <br /><br />Lennon Hayes is supposed to be on her honeymoon. Instead, she’s alone and single, vacationing next door to a surly tattooed man who ran his date off the resort. When a run-in at the bar results in a night of bickering and cocktails, she finds herself tumbling into bed with the enemy next door, then sneaking out before the sun comes up. <br /><br />Lennon’s plan to start over in a new city is going great, until she starts her new job. The job? The Vancouver Vipers’ new photographer. And the defenseman scowling at her from across the room? The one-night stand she wasn’t supposed to see again. Good thing neither of them are looking for anything serious… Right? <br /><br />Jaxon may not be used to falling, but if he’s going to go, he refuses to go alone.

But after an anonymous one-night stand on his last night in town, his luck turns around and a last-minute roster spot opens up on the Seattle Rainiers. Connecting his fortune to the girl he spent the night with, superstitious Jaylen is suddenly desperate to keep her around.<br /><br />Aspiring tattoo artist Lucy isn’t so sure about the proposition to remain Jaylen’s lucky charm—she’s been called a lot of things in her life, but good luck has never been one of them. But stuck in a career slump, Lucy has everything to gain. Hoping for an apprenticeship at a tattoo parlor hasn’t offered her much stability, and Jaylen is willing to pay any price to get Lucy to agree…so maybe sending him a routine text message before each game won’t be too hard.<br /><br />What starts as an agreement to trade favors—a good luck text for an appearance at a charity event, or well wishes in exchange for prime game tickets—quickly turns into sizzling chemistry that’s too delicious not to give in to. But Lucy’s been in too many situationships to even think about getting attached again, and Jaylen is clearly only with Lucy as long as it’s helping his career…neither of them expecting getting lucky could be so complicated.",Lexi LaFleur Brown,369762657,Alex,2,"Fri, 21 Mar 2025 00:00:00","Thu, 20 Mar 2025 00:00:00","Thu, 20 Mar 2025 14:00:23 -0700",,,3.37,2025,"<a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/213435549-shoot-your-shot?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss""><img alt=""Shoot Your Shot"" src=""https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1729681494l/213435549._SY75_.jpg"" /></a><br />

Do not turn the key. Do not open the gate.<br /><br /> Twenty-four-year-old Saeris Fane is good at keeping secrets. No one knows about the strange powers she possesses, or the fact that she has been picking pockets and stealing from the Undying Queen’s reservoirs for as long as she can remember. In the land of the unforgiving desert, there isn’t much a girl wouldn’t do for a glass of water. But a secret is like a knot. Sooner or later, it is bound to come undone.<br /><br /> When Saeris comes face-to-face with Death himself, she inadvertently reopens a gateway between realms and is transported to a land of ice and snow. The Fae have always been the stuff of myth, of legend, of nightmares…but it turns out they’re real, and Saeris has landed right in the middle of a centuries-long conflict that might just get her killed.<br /><br /> The first of her kind to tread the frozen mountains of Yvelia in over a thousand years, Saeris mistakenly binds herself to Kingfisher, a handsome Fae warrior, who has secrets and nefarious agendas of his own. He will use her Alchemist’s magic to protect his people, no matter what it costs him… or her. Death has a name. It is Kingfisher of the Ajun Gate. His past is murky. His attitude stinks. And he’s the only way Saeris is going to make it home.<br /><br /> Be careful of the deals you make, dear child. The devil is in the details... Now with an embossed cover, silver foiling, and an updated interior design.  <br /><br /><b>N.B.

It’s all a lie.<br /><br />Jane Jackson knows that true love is a lie. Laughter is the only truth—you can’t fake a belly laugh. Jane should know, she spent her adolescence as ""Poor Janey Jakes,"" the barbecue-sauce-in-her-braces punchline on America's fifth-favorite sitcom. Now she’s a Creative Executive at Clearwater Studios and she’s living by a new mantra: Fake it till you make it.<br /><br />Except, she might have faked it too far. Desperate to get her first project greenlit and riled up by pompous cinematographer and one-time crush Dan Finnegan, she opened her mouth and a big fat fib fell out. She claimed that Jack Quinlan, hottest popstar of the moment, has promised to write an original song for the soundtrack. Jack may have been her first kiss—and greatest source of shame—but she hasn’t spoken to him in twenty years.<br /><br />Now, Jane must turn to the last man she’d ever want to owe: Dan Finnegan. Because Jack is playing a festival in Dan’s hometown on Long Island, and Dan has an in. A week in close quarters with Dan while facing down her past is Jane's idea of hell, but Dan just might surprise her.

  <b>From New York Times and USA Today bestselling author comes a brand new sizzling summer read that will have you laughing, swooning . . . and sweating. </b>
</i><br /><br />Scottie Price just started a new job and it's a real sausage fest. She's the only woman on a team filled with Brads and Chads. Expecting a bachelor pad atmosphere, she is quickly corrected when she finds out everyone is happily married.<br /> <br />In an effort to impress her boss, Scottie mentions her nonexistent husband in a company meeting. But eagle-eyed Chad points out her lack of wedding ring. Panicked, Scottie creates a story about her unhappy marriage. Unfortunately for Scottie, her boss has a solution—a one-on-one session with the best marriage counselor in the Northeast, who happens to be her boss’s husband.<br /> <br />With no way out of her lie, Scottie agrees to see him. Frantic, she calls in help from her best friend who sets her up with his brother, an improv-obsessed millionaire.<br /> <br />Enter Wilder Wells. More than happy to take on the job, he teaches Scottie the main rule of always say yes. But the rule backfires during the session when Wilder signs them up for an eight-day summer marriage camp with all of Scottie’s co-workers where she’ll have to share a cabin with her way-too-handsome fake husband.<br />",Meghan Quinn,1959442341,Alex,4,"Sat, 21 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000","Sat, 21 Jun 2025 19:39:10 -0700","Thu, 19 Jun 2025 14:09:44 -0700",,,4.21,2025,"<a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/227939188-till-summer-do-us-part?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss""><img alt=""Till Summer Do Us Part"" src=""https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1739375209l/227939188._SY75_.jpg"" /></a><br />

As Conor loves to remind her, the power dynamic is too imbalanced. Any relationship between them would be problematic in too many ways to count, and Maya should just get over him. After all, he has made it clear that he wants her gone from his life.<br /><br />But not everything is as it seems—and clichés sometimes become plot twists.<br /><br />When Maya’s brother decides to get married in Taormina, she and Conor end up stuck together in a romantic Sicilian villa for over a week. There, on the beautiful Ionian coast, between ancient ruins, delicious foods, and natural caves, Maya realizes that Conor might be hiding something from her. And as the destination wedding begins to erupt out of control, she decides that a summer fling might be just what she needs—even if it’s a problematic one.",Ali Hazelwood,,Alex,4,"Sat, 31 May 2025 00:00:00","Mon, 17 Mar 2025 00:00:00","Mon, 17 Mar 2025 11:06:35 -0700",,,4.06,2025,"<a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/228731649-problematic-summer-romance?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss""><img alt=""Problematic Summer Romance (Not in Love, #2)"" src=""https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1745436985l/228731649._SY75_.jpg"" /></a><br />

Diagnosed with bipolar disorder at a young age, she's never fit in with her family, her friends, her community. Lizzie wants to be accepted and understood, but with few family or friends in her corner, she's carries her burdens and her trauma on her own.<br /><br />But when she meets a kind boy on the school bus, things start to look bright for the first time in her life…<br /><br />Hugh Biggs has an old soul and the wisdom of someone far beyond his years. A young man with a sharp mind and a firm code of ethics, he sees something in Lizzie Young that he can't resist. He wants to be her everything and shoulder her burden. And Lizzie wants that too.<br /><br />Lizzie and Hugh's bond seems unbreakable — their chemistry is electric, their love is potent, and their connection is soul deep – but even the truest love can be shaken by forces beyond control.<br /><br />Warning: Releasing 10 tackles several sensitive topics, including childhood abuse, sexual trauma, CSA, grooming, abortion, forced miscarriage, self-harm, and suicide.
